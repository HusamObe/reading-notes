## React Context and Data Sharing

**React Context:**  
React Context is a feature in React that enables sharing state or data between components without the need to pass data through each component level. It's used to manage global or shared state that multiple components might need to access and update. Context creates a centralized store of data accessible by components within its scope.

**Managing State and Data Sharing:**  
React Context simplifies state and data sharing by allowing you to define a context holding the shared data. This context can be accessed by any component within its hierarchy, eliminating the need to pass props across multiple levels. This is useful for scenarios like themes, user authentication, and language preferences.

## The useContext Hook

The `useContext` hook is a React hook that allows functional components to access data from a React Context.

```jsx
import React, { useContext } from 'react';

const MyContext = React.createContext();

function MyComponent() {
  const contextData = useContext(MyContext);
  
  return (
    <div>
      Data from Context: {contextData}
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Next.js and Scalable Web Apps

## Next.js

Next.js is a React framework focused on building server-rendered React applications. It offers server-side rendering, routing, and more out of the box, simplifying web app development.

## Example: "With Apollo" from Vercel Next.js Examples

The "With Apollo" example demonstrates integrating Apollo Client with a Next.js app to fetch data from a GraphQL API. This showcases server-side rendering for GraphQL data, handling loading states, and optimizing performance.

This combination of features enhances initial loading times, SEO, and dynamic interactivity in web apps, making Next.js suitable for scalable and performant applications.

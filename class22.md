## How Docker Streamlines Development and Deployment:

Docker containers offer several benefits for streamlining development and deployment:

- Consistency: Ensures consistent behavior across different environments.
- Isolation: Isolates the application and its dependencies for clean execution.
- Portability: Enables deployment across various platforms with ease.
- Scalability: Allows easy scaling of applications by replicating containers.
- Efficiency: Lightweight nature and resource utilization for faster deployment.
- Versioning: Facilitates versioning for easy rollbacks if issues arise.

# Django vs. Django REST framework (DRF)

## Primary Differences:

- Django is a general-purpose web framework for full-featured web applications.
- DRF is a specialized extension of Django for building web APIs.
- DRF provides serializers for converting data into JSON/XML responses.
- Django uses templates for rendering HTML responses.
- DRF uses routers for generating URL patterns automatically for APIs.
- DRF offers powerful permissions and token-based authentication for APIs.
- Django and DRF serve different purposes but can be used together in projects.
